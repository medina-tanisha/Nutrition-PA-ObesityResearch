### Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity Data a Project with Python

#### Python file contains more information about data retrieval and proposals. 

### Summary
With all the visualizations and information I have gathered from each I would like to propose a larger 
research question. 

What is the complex relationship between obesity, physical activity, income, and age across 
different states in the US? How do these factors interact to influence obesity prevalence in different age 
groups? 

  My conclusion is that there are no outstanding significant differences in obesity by age group 
however it is more likely that a person is obese the older they become. Income impacts obesity and 
being overweight very little. We see that each income bracket has equal likelihood of being obese or 
overweight. However, it should be mentioned that the highest and lowest income brackets do show an 
increase in overweightness and people who are obese. This could be because the more money you have 
it is easier to gain resources and have access to equipment or help that can promote a healthy lifestyle 
ultimately reducing the risk of obesity. The lower income bracket may experience hardship in purchasing 
healthier foods and obtaining resources to prevent obesity. This could be a reason there are slightly 
more obese people in the annual income bracket of less than $15,000. Each state has approximately the 
same distribution of age groups with obesity. However, from our data we can see that the state of 
Virginia does not have a lot of people that are classified for this comparison. When we observe the 
physical activity of each age group it is clear to see that younger people (34 or younger) participate in 
more strength training exercises than older people. People over 65 years in age are most likely to not 
participate in any physical at all. My data helps prove my conclusions. It also makes sense that older 
people are less likely to work out let alone strength train because they are prone to having more bodily 
injuries and may have more pre-existing conditions that prevent them from performing certain 
exercises.
